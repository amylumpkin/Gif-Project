# Gif-Project

This project makes use of the GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page that populates still image gifs. 

Users can click one of the existing topic buttons on the page to display related gifs. As well, they can add their own topic button by typing the value into the input box and clicking 'submit'.

Users can then click on the images to animate them and click again to make them return to their static, non-animated state.
